title: Learning under Misspecified Objective Spaces
abstract: 'Learning robot objective functions from human input has become increasingly
  important, but state-of-the-art techniques assume that the human’s desired objective
  lies within the robot’s hypothesis space. When this is not true, even methods that
  keep track of uncertainty over the objective fail because they reason about which
  hypothesis might be correct, and not whether any of the hypotheses are correct.
  We focus specifically on learning from physical human corrections during the robot’s
  task execution, where not having a rich enough hypothesis space leads to the robot
  updating its objective in ways that the person did not actually intend. We observe
  that such corrections appear irrelevant to the robot, because they are not the best
  way of achieving any of the candidate objectives. Instead of naively trusting and
  learning from every human interaction, we propose robots learn conservatively by
  reasoning in real time about how relevant the human’s correction is for the robot’s
  hypothesis space. We test our inference method in an experiment with human interaction
  data, and demonstrate that this alleviates unintended learning in an in-person user
  study with a robot manipulator. '
