title: Batch Active Preference-Based Learning of Reward Functions
abstract: 'Data generation and labeling are usually an expensive part of learning
  for robotics. While active learning methods are commonly used to tackle the former
  problem, preference-based learning is a concept that attempts to solve the latter
  by querying users with preference questions. In this paper, we will develop a new
  algorithm, batch active preference-based learning, that enables efficient learning
  of reward functions using as few data samples as possible while still having short
  query generation times. We introduce several approximations to the batch active
  learning problem, and provide theoretical guarantees for the convergence of our
  algorithms. Finally, we present our experimental results for a variety of robotics
  tasks in simulation. Our results suggest that our batch active learning algorithm
  requires only a few queries that are computed in a short amount of time. We then
  showcase our algorithm in a study to learn human usersâ€™ preferences. '
