title: Grounding Robot Plans from Natural Language Instructions with Incomplete World
  Knowledge
abstract: 'Our goal is to enable robots to interpret and execute high-level tasks
  conveyed using natural language instructions. For example, consider tasking a household
  robot to, “prepare my breakfast”, “clear the boxes on the table” or “make me a fruit
  milkshake”. Interpreting such underspecified instructions requires environmental
  context and background knowledge about how to accomplish complex tasks. Further,
  the robot’s workspace knowledge may be incomplete: the environment may only be partially-observed
  or background knowledge may be missing causing a failure in plan synthesis. We introduce
  a probabilistic model that utilizes background knowledge to infer latent or missing
  plan constituents based on semantic co-associations learned from noisy textual corpora
  of task descriptions. The ability to infer missing plan constituents enables information-seeking
  actions such as visual exploration or dialogue with the human to acquire new knowledge
  to fill incomplete plans. Results indicate robust plan inference from under-specified
  instructions in partially-known worlds. '
