title: 'Composable Action-Conditioned Predictors: Flexible Off-Policy Learning for
  Robot Navigation'
abstract: 'A general-purpose intelligent robot must be able to learn autonomously
  and be able to accomplish multiple tasks in order to be deployed in the real world.
  However, standard reinforcement learning approaches learn separate task-specific
  policies and assume the reward function for each task is known a priori. We propose
  a framework that learns event cues from off-policy data, and can flexibly combine
  these event cues at test time to accomplish different tasks. These event cue labels
  are not assumed to be known a priori, but are instead labeled using learned models,
  such as computer vision detectors, and then “backed up” in time using an action-conditioned
  predictive model. We show that a simulated robotic car and a real-world RC car can
  gather data and train fully autonomously without any human-provided labels beyond
  those needed to train the detectors, and then at test-time be able to accomplish
  a variety of different tasks. Videos of the experiments and code can be found at
