title: Leveraging Deep Visual Descriptors for Hierarchical Efficient Localization
abstract: Many robotics applications require precise pose estimates despite operating
  in large and changing environments. This can be addressed by visual localization,
  using a pre-computed 3D model of the surroundings. The pose estimation then amounts
  to finding correspondences between 2D keypoints in a query image and 3D points in
  the model using local descriptors. However, computational power is often limited
  on robotic platforms, making this task challenging in large-scale environments.
  Binary feature descriptors significantly speed up this 2D-3D matching, and have
  become popular in the robotics community, but also strongly impair the robustness
  to perceptual aliasing and changes in viewpoint, illumination and scene structure.
  In this work, we propose to leverage recent advances in deep learning to perform
  an efficient hierarchical localization. We first localize at the map level using
  learned image-wide global descriptors, and subsequently estimate a precise pose
  from 2D-3D matches computed in the candidate places only. This restricts the local
  search and thus allows to efficiently exploit powerful non-binary descriptors usually
  dismissed on resource-constrained devices. Our approach results in state-of-the-art
  localization performance while running in real-time on a popular mobile platform,
  enabling new prospects for robotics research.
