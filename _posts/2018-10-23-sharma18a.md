title: 'Multiple Interactions Made Easy (MIME): Large Scale Demonstrations Data for
  Imitation'
abstract: 'In recent years, we have seen an emergence of data-driven approaches in
  robotics. However, most existing efforts and datasets are either in simulation or
  focus on a single task in isolation such as grasping, pushing or poking. In order
  to make progress and capture the space of manipulation, we would need to collect
  a large-scale dataset of diverse tasks such as pouring, opening bottles, stacking
  objects etc. But how does one collect such a dataset? In this paper, we present
  the largest available robotic-demonstration dataset (MIME) that contains 8260 human-robot
  demonstrations over 20 different robotic tasks2. These tasks range from the simple
  task of pushing objects to the difficult task of stacking household objects. Our
  dataset consists of videos of human demonstrations and kinesthetic trajectories
  of robot demonstrations. We also propose to use this dataset for the task of mapping
  3rd person video features to robot trajectories. Furthermore, we present two different
  approaches using this dataset and evaluate the predicted robot trajectories against
  ground-truth trajectories. We hope our dataset inspires research in multiple areas
  including visual imitation, trajectory prediction and multi-task robotic learning. '
