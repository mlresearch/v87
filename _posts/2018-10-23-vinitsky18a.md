title: Benchmarks for reinforcement learning in mixed-autonomy traffic
abstract: We release new benchmarks in the use of deep reinforcement learning (RL)
  to create controllers for mixed-autonomy traffic, where connected and autonomous
  vehicles (CAVs) interact with human drivers and infrastructure. Benchmarks, such
  as Mujoco or the Arcade Learning Environment, have spurred new research by enabling
  researchers to effectively compare their results so that they can focus on algorithmic
  improvements and control techniques rather than system design. To promote similar
  advances in traffic control via RL, we propose four benchmarks, based on three new
  traffic scenarios, illustrating distinct reinforcement learning problems with applications
  to mixed-autonomy traffic. We provide an introduction to each control problem, an
  overview of their MDP structures, and preliminary performance results from commonly
  used RL algorithms. For the purpose of reproducibility, the benchmarks, reference
  implementations, and tutorials are available at https://github.com/flow-project/flow.
