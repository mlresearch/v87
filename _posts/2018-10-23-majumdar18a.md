title: 'PAC-Bayes Control: Synthesizing Controllers that Provably Generalize to Novel
  Environments'
abstract: Our goal is to synthesize controllers for robots that provably generalize
  well to novel environments given a dataset of example environments. The key technical
  idea behind our approach is to leverage tools from generalization theory in machine
  learning by exploiting a precise analogy (which we present in the form of a reduction)
  between robustness of controllers to novel environments and generalization of hypotheses
  in supervised learning. In particular, we utilize the Probably Approximately Correct
  (PAC)-Bayes framework, which allows us to obtain upper bounds (that hold with high
  probability) on the expected cost of (stochastic) controllers across novel environments.
  We propose control synthesis algorithms that explicitly seek to minimize this upper
  bound. The corresponding optimization problem can be solved efficiently using convex
  optimization (Relative Entropy Programming in particular) in the setting where we
  are optimizing over a finite control policy space. In the more general setting of
  continuously parameterized controllers, we minimize this upper bound using stochastic
  gradient descent. We present examples of our approach in the context of obstacle
  avoidance control with depth measurements. Our simulated examples demonstrate the
  potential of our approach to provide strong generalization guarantees on controllers
  for robotic systems with continuous state and action spaces, nonlinear dynamics,
  and partially observable state via sensor measurements.
