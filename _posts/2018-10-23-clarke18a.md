title: Learning Audio Feedback for Estimating Amount and Flow of Granular Material
abstract: 'Granular materials produce audio-frequency mechanical vibrations in air
  and structures when manipulated. These vibrations correlate with both the nature
  of the events and the intrinsic properties of the materials producing them. We therefore
  propose learning to use audio-frequency vibrations from contact events to estimate
  the flow and amount of granular materials during scooping and pouring tasks. We
  evaluated multiple deep and shallow learning frameworks on a dataset of 13,750 shaking
  and pouring samples across five different granular materials. Our results indicate
  that audio is an informative sensor modality for accurately estimating flow and
  amounts, with a mean RMSE of 2.8g across the five materials for pouring. We also
  demonstrate how the learned networks can be used to pour a desired amount of material. '
