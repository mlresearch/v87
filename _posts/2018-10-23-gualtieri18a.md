title: Learning 6-DoF Grasping and Pick-Place Using Attention Focus
abstract: 'We address a class of manipulation problems where the robot perceives the
  scene with a depth sensor and can move its end effector in a space with six degrees
  of freedomâ€”3D position and orientation. Our approach is to formulate the problem
  as a Markov decision process (MDP) with abstract yet generally applicable state
  and action representations. Finding a good solution to the MDP requires adding constraints
  on the allowed actions. We develop a specific set of constraints called hierarchical
  SE(3) sampling (HSE3S) which causes the robot to learn a sequence of gazes to focus
  attention on the task-relevant parts of the scene. We demonstrate the effectiveness
  of our approach on three challenging pick-place tasks (with novel objects in clutter
  and nontrivial places) both in simulation and on a real robot, even though all training
  is done in simulation. '
