title: Reinforcement Learning of Active Vision for Manipulating Objects under Occlusions
abstract: 'We consider artificial agents that learn to jointly control their gripper
  and camera in order to reinforcement learn manipulation policies in the presence
  of occlusions from distractor objects. Distractors often occlude the object of interest
  and cause it to disappear from the field of view. We propose hand/eye controllers
  that learn to move the camera to keep the object within the field of view and visible,
  in coordination to manipulating it to achieve the desired goal, e.g., pushing it
  to a target location. We incorporate structural biases of object-centric attention
  within our actor-critic architectures, which our experiments suggest to be a key
  for good performance. Our results further highlight the importance of curriculum
  with regards to environment difficulty. The resulting active vision / manipulation
  policies outperform static camera setups for a variety of cluttered environments. '
