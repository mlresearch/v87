title: Few-Shot Goal Inference for Visuomotor Learning and Planning
abstract: 'Reinforcement learning and planning methods require an objective or reward
  function that encodes the desired behavior. Yet, in practice, there is a wide range
  of scenarios where an objective is difficult to provide programmatically, such as
  tasks with visual observations involving unknown object positions or deformable
  objects. In these cases, prior methods use engineered problem-specific solutions,
  e.g., by instrumenting the environment with additional sensors to measure a proxy
  for the objective. Such solutions require a significant engineering effort on a
  per-task basis, and make it impractical for robots to continuously learn complex
  skills outside of laboratory settings. We aim to find a more general and scalable
  solution for specifying goals for robot learning in unconstrained environments.
  To that end, we formulate the few-shot objective learning problem, where the goal
  is to learn a task objective from only a few example images of successful end states
  for that task. We propose a simple solution to this problem: meta-learn a classifier
  that can recognize new goals from a few examples. We show how this approach can
  be used with both model-free reinforcement learning and visual model-based planning
  and show results in three domains: rope manipulation from images in simulation,
  visual navigation in a simulated 3D environment, and object arrangement into user-specified
  configurations on a real robot.'
