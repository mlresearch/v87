title: Bayesian RL for Goal-Only Rewards
abstract: 'We address the challenging problem of reinforcement learning under goal-only
  rewards [1], where rewards are only non-zero when the goal is achieved. This reward
  definition alleviates the need for cumbersome reward engineering, making the reward
  formulation trivial. Classic exploration heuristics such as Boltzmann or epsilon-greedy
  exploration are highly inefficient in domains with goal-only rewards. We solve this
  problem by leveraging value function posterior variance information to direct exploration
  where uncertainty is higher. The proposed algorithm (EMU-Q) achieves data-efficient
  exploration, and balances exploration and exploitation explicitly at a policy level
  granting users more control over the learning process. We introduce general features
  approximating kernels, allowing to greatly reduce the algorithm complexity from
  O(N^3) in the number of transitions to O(M^2) in the number of features. We demonstrate
  EMU-Q is competitive with other exploration techniques on a variety of continuous
  control tasks and on a robotic manipulator. '
