title: Policies Modulating Trajectory Generators
abstract: 'We propose an architecture for learning complex controllable behaviors
  by having simple Policies Modulate Trajectory Generators (PMTG), a powerful combination
  that can provide both memory and prior knowledge to the controller. The result is
  a flexible architecture that is applicable to a class of problems with periodic
  motion for which one has an insight into the class of trajectories that might lead
  to a desired behavior. We illustrate the basics of our architecture using a synthetic
  control problem, then go on to learn speed-controlled locomotion for a quadrupedal
  robot by using Deep Reinforcement Learning and Evolutionary Strategies. We demonstrate
  that a simple linear policy, when paired with a parametric Trajectory Generator
  for quadrupedal gaits, can induce walking behaviors with controllable speed from
  4-dimensional IMU observations alone, and can be learned in under 1000 rollouts.
  We also transfer these policies to a real robot and show locomotion with controllable
  forward velocity. '
