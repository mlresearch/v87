title: 'HybridNet: Integrating Model-based and Data-driven Learning to Predict Evolution
  of Dynamical Systems'
abstract: 'The robotic systems continuously interact with complex dynamical systems
  in the physical world. Reliable predictions of spatiotemporal evolution of these
  dynamical systems, with limited knowledge of system dynamics, are crucial for autonomous
  operation. In this paper, we present HybridNet, a framework that integrates data-driven
  deep learning and model-driven computation to reliably predict spatiotemporal evolution
  of a dynamical systems even with in-exact knowledge of their parameters. A data-driven
  deep neural network (DNN) with Convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) as the backbone is
  employed to predict the time-varying evolution of the external forces/perturbations.
  On the other hand, the model-driven computation is performed using Cellular Neural
  Network (CeNN), a neuro-inspired algorithm to model dynamical systems defined by
  coupled partial differential equations (PDEs). CeNN converts the intricate numerical
  computation into a series of convolution operations, enabling a trainable PDE solver.
  With a feedback control loop, HybridNet can learn the physical parameters governing
  the systemâ€™s dynamics in real-time, and accordingly adapt the computation models
  to enhance prediction accuracy for time-evolving dynamical systems. The experimental
  results on two dynamical systems, namely, heat convection-diffusion system, and
  fluid dynamical system, demonstrate that the HybridNet produces higher accuracy
  than the state-of-the-art deep learning based approach. '
