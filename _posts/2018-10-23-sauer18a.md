title: Conditional Affordance Learning for Driving in Urban Environments
abstract: 'Most existing approaches to autonomous driving fall into one of two categories:
  modular pipelines, that build an extensive model of the environment, and imitation
  learning approaches, that map images directly to control outputs. A recently proposed
  third paradigm, direct perception, aims to combine the advantages of both by using
  a neural network to learn appropriate low-dimensional intermediate representations.
  However, existing direct perception approaches are restricted to simple highway
  situations, lacking the ability to navigate intersections, stop at traffic lights
  or respect speed limits. In this work, we propose a direct perception approach which
  maps video input to intermediate representations suitable for autonomous navigation
  in complex urban environments given high-level directional inputs. Compared to state-of-the-art
  reinforcement and conditional imitation learning approaches, we achieve an improvement
  of up to 68 % in goal-directed navigation on the challenging CARLA simulation benchmark.
  In addition, our approach is the first to handle traffic lights and speed signs
  by using image-level labels only, as well as smooth car-following, resulting in
  a significant reduction of traffic accidents in simulation. '
