title: Sim-to-Real Reinforcement Learning for Deformable Object Manipulation
abstract: We have seen much recent progress in rigid object manipulation, but interaction
  with deformable objects has notably lagged behind. Due to the large configuration
  space of deformable objects, solutions using traditional modelling approaches require
  significant engineering work. Perhaps then, bypassing the need for explicit modelling
  and instead learning the control in an end-to-end manner serves as a better approach?
  Despite the growing interest in the use of end-to-end robot learning approaches,
  only a small amount of work has focused on their applicability to deformable object
  manipulation. Moreover, due to the large amount of data needed to learn these end-to-end
  solutions, an emerging trend is to learn control policies in simulation and then
  transfer them over to the real world. To date, no work has explored whether it is
  possible to learn and transfer deformable object policies. We believe that if sim-to-real
  methods are to be employed further, then it should be possible to learn to interact
  with a wide variety of objects, and not only rigid objects. In this work, we use
  a combination of state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning algorithms to solve
  the problem of manipulating deformable objects (specifically cloth). We evaluate
  our approach on three tasksâ€”folding a towel up to a mark, folding a face towel diagonally,
  and draping a piece of cloth over a hanger. Our agents are fully trained in simulation
  with domain randomisation, and then successfully deployed in the real world without
  having seen any real deformable objects.
