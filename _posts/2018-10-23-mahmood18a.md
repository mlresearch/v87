title: Benchmarking Reinforcement Learning Algorithms on Real-World Robots
abstract: "\r Through many recent successes in simulation, model-free reinforcement
  learning has emerged as a promising approach to solving continuous control robotic
  tasks. The research community is now able to reproduce, analyze and build quickly
  on these results due to open source implementations of learning algorithms and simulated
  benchmark tasks. To carry forward these successes to real-world applications, it
  is crucial to withhold utilizing the unique advantages of simulations that do not
  transfer to the real world and experiment directly with physical robots. However,
  reinforcement learning research with physical robots faces substantial resistance
  due to the lack of benchmark tasks and supporting source code. In this work, we
  introduce several reinforcement learning tasks with multiple commercially available
  robots that present varying levels of learning difficulty, setup, and repeatability.
  On these tasks, we test the learning performance of off-the-shelf implementations
  of four reinforcement learning algorithms and analyze sensitivity to their hyper-parameters
  to determine their readiness for applications in various real-world tasks. Our results
  show that with a careful setup of the task interface and computations, some of these
  implementations can be readily applicable to physical robots. We find that state-of-the-art
  learning algorithms are highly sensitive to their hyper-parameters and their relative
  ordering does not transfer across tasks, indicating the necessity of re-tuning them
  for each task for best performance. On the other hand, the best hyper-parameter
  configuration from one task may often result in effective learning on held-out tasks
  even with different robots, providing a reasonable default. We make the benchmark
  tasks publicly available to enhance reproducibility in real-world reinforcement
  learning."
