title: Automorphing Kernels for Nonstationarity in Mapping Unstructured Environments
abstract: 'In order to deploy robots in previously unseen and unstructured environments,
  the robots should have the capacity to learn on their own and adapt to the changes
  in the environments. For instance, in mobile robotics, a robot should be able to
  learn a map of the environment from data itself without the intervention of a human
  to tune the parameters of the model. To this end, leveraging the latest developments
  in automatic machine learning (AutoML), probabilistic programming, and statistical
  sampling, under the Hilbert mapping framework which can represent the occupancy
  of the environment as a continuous function of locations, we formulate a Bayesian
  framework to learn all parameters of the map. Crucially, this way, the robot is
  capable of learning the optimal shapes and placement of the kernels in Hilbert maps
  by merely embedding high-level human knowledge of the problem by means of prior
  probability distributions. Since the proposed framework employs stochastic variational
  inference, the model learns tens of thousands of parameters within minutes in both
  big data and data-scarce regimes. Experiments conducted on simulated and real-world
  datasets in static and dynamic environments indicate the proposed method significantly
  outperforms existing stationary occupancy mapping techniques, verifying the importance
  of learning the interdependent position-shape relationship of kernels alongside
  other model parameters. '
