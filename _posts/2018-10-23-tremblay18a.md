title: Deep Object Pose Estimation for Semantic Robotic Grasping of Household Objects
abstract: Using synthetic data for training deep neural networks for robotic manipulation
  holds the promise of an almost unlimited amount of pre-labeled training data, generated
  safely out of harmâ€™s way. One of the key challenges of synthetic data, to date,
  has been to bridge the so-called reality gap, so that networks trained on synthetic
  data operate correctly when exposed to real-world data. We explore the reality gap
  in the context of 6-DoF pose estimation of known objects from a single RGB image.
  We show that for this problem the reality gap can be successfully spanned by a simple
  combination of domain randomized and photorealistic data. Using synthetic data generated
  in this manner, we introduce a one-shot deep neural network that is able to perform
  competitively against a state-of-the-art network trained on a combination of real
  and synthetic data. To our knowledge, this is the first deep network trained only
  on synthetic data that is able to achieve state-of-the-art performance on 6-DoF
  object pose estimation. Our network also generalizes better to novel environments
  including extreme lighting conditions, for which we show qualitative results. Using
  this network we demonstrate a real-time system estimating object poses with sufficient
  accuracy for real-world semantic grasping of known household objects in clutter
  by a real robot.
