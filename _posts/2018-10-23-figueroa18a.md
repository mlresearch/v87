title: A Physically-Consistent Bayesian Non-Parametric Mixture Model for Dynamical
  System Learning
abstract: 'We propose a physically-consistent Bayesian non-parametric approach for
  fitting Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) to trajectory data. Physical-consistency of
  the GMM is ensured by imposing a prior on the component assignments biased by a
  novel similarity metric that leverages locality and directionality. The resulting
  GMM is then used to learn globally asymptotically stable Dynamical Systems (DS)
  via a Linear Parameter Varying (LPV) re-formulation. The proposed DS learning scheme
  accurately encodes challenging nonlinear motions automatically. Finally, a data-efficient
  incremental learning framework is introduced that encodes a DS from batches of trajectories,
  while preserving global stability. Our contributions are validated on 2D datasets
  and a variety of tasks that involve single-target complex motions with a KUKA LWR
  4+ robot arm. '
