title: Mapping Navigation Instructions to Continuous Control Actions with Position-Visitation
  Prediction
abstract: 'We propose an approach for mapping natural language instructions and raw
  observations to continuous control of a quadcopter drone. Our model predicts interpretable
  position-visitation distributions indicating where the agent should go during execution
  and where it should stop, and uses the predicted distributions to select the actions
  to execute. This two-step model decomposition allows for simple and efficient training
  using a combination of supervised learning and imitation learning. We evaluate our
  approach with a realistic drone simulator, and demonstrate absolute task-completion
  accuracy improvements of 16.85% over two state-of-the-art instruction-following
  methods. '
