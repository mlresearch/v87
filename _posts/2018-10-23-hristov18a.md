title: Interpretable Latent Spaces for Learning from Demonstration
abstract: 'Effective human-robot interaction, such as in robot learning from human
  demonstration, requires the learning agent to be able to ground abstract concepts
  (such as those contained within instructions) in a corresponding high-dimensional
  sensory input stream from the world. Models such as deep neural networks, with high
  capacity through their large parameter spaces, can be used to compress the high-dimensional
  sensory data to lower dimensional representations. These low-dimensional representations
  facilitate symbol grounding, but may not guarantee that the representation would
  be human-interpretable. We propose a method which utilises the grouping of user-defined
  symbols and their corresponding sensory observations in order to align the learnt
  compressed latent representation with the semantic notions contained in the abstract
  labels. We demonstrate this through experiments with both simulated and real-world
  object data, showing that such alignment can be achieved in a process of physical
  symbol grounding. '
