title: 'Guided Feature Transformation (GFT): A Neural Language Grounding Module for
  Embodied Agents'
abstract: Recently there has been a rising interest in training agents, embodied in
  virtual environments, to perform language-directed tasks by deep reinforcement learning.
  In this paper, we propose a simple but effective neural language grounding module
  for embodied agents that can be trained end to end from scratch taking raw pixels,
  unstructured linguistic commands, and sparse rewards as the inputs. We model the
  language grounding process as a language-guided transformation of visual features,
  where latent sentence embeddings are used as the transformation matrices. In several
  language-directed navigation tasks that feature challenging partial observability
  and require simple reasoning, our module significantly outperforms the state of
  the art. We also release XWORLD3D, an easy-to-customize 3D environment that can
  be modified to evaluate a variety of embodied agents.
