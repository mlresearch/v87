title: 'ROBOTURK: A Crowdsourcing Platform for Robotic Skill Learning through Imitation'
abstract: 'Imitation Learning has empowered recent advances in learning robotic manipulation
  tasks by addressing shortcomings of Reinforcement Learning such as exploration and
  reward specification. However, research in this area has been limited to modest-sized
  datasets due to the difficulty of collecting large quantities of task demonstrations
  through existing mechanisms. This work introduces ROBO-TURK to address this challenge.
  ROBOTURK is a crowdsourcing platform for high quality 6-DoF trajectory based teleoperation
  through the use of widely available mobile devices (e.g. iPhone). We evaluate ROBOTURK
  on three manipulation tasks of varying timescales (15-120s) and observe that our
  user interface is statistically similar to special purpose hardware such as virtual
  reality controllers in terms of task completion times. Furthermore, we observe that
  poor network conditions, such as low bandwidth and high delay links, do not substantially
  affect the remote usersâ€™ ability to perform task demonstrations successfully on
  ROBOTURK. Lastly, we demonstrate the efficacy of ROBOTURK through the collection
  of a pilot dataset; using ROBOTURK, we collected 137.5 hours of manipulation data
  from remote workers, amounting to over 2200 successful task demonstrations in 22
  hours of total system usage. We show that the data obtained through ROBOTURK enables
  policy learning on multi-step manipulation tasks with sparse rewards and that using
  larger quantities of demonstrations during policy learning provides benefits in
  terms of both learning consistency and final performance. For additional results,
