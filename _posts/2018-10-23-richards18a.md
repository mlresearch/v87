title: 'The Lyapunov Neural Network: Adaptive Stability Certification for Safe Learning
  of Dynamical Systems'
abstract: 'Learning algorithms have shown considerable prowess in simulation by allowing
  robots to adapt to uncertain environments and improve their performance. However,
  such algorithms are rarely used in practice on safety-critical systems, since the
  learned policy typically does not yield any safety guarantees. That is, the required
  exploration may cause physical harm to the robot or its environment. In this paper,
  we present a method to learn accurate safety certificates for nonlinear, closed-loop
  dynamical systems. Specifically, we construct a neural network Lyapunov function
  and a training algorithm that adapts it to the shape of the largest safe region
  in the state space. The algorithm relies only on knowledge of inputs and outputs
  of the dynamics, rather than on any specific model structure. We demonstrate our
  method by learning the safe region of attraction for a simulated inverted pendulum.
  Furthermore, we discuss how our method can be used in safe learning algorithms together
  with statistical models of dynamical systems. '
