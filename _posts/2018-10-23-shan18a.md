title: Bayesian Generalized Kernel Inference for Terrain Traversability Mapping
abstract: 'We propose a new approach for traversability mapping with sparse lidar
  scans collected by ground vehicles, which leverages probabilistic inference to build
  descriptive terrain maps. Enabled by recent developments in sparse kernels, Bayesian
  generalized kernel inference is applied sequentially to the related problems of
  terrain elevation and traversability inference. The first inference step allows
  sparse data to support descriptive terrain modeling, and the second inference step
  relieves the burden typically associated with traversability computation. We explore
  the capabilities of the approach over a variety of data and terrain, demonstrating
  its suitability for online use in real-world applications. '
