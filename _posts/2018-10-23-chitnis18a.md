title: Learning What Information to Give in Partially Observed Domains
abstract: In many robotic applications, an autonomous agent must act within and explore
  a partially observed environment that is unobserved by its human team-mate. We consider
  such a setting in which the agent can, while acting, transmit declarative information
  to the human that helps them understand aspects of this unseen environment. In this
  work, we address the algorithmic question of how the agent should plan out what
  actions to take and what information to transmit. Naturally, one would expect the
  human to have preferences, which we model information-theoretically by scoring transmitted
  information based on the change it induces in weighted entropy of the human’s belief
  state. We formulate this setting as a belief MDP and give a tractable algorithm
  for solving it approximately. Then, we give an algorithm that allows the agent to
  learn the human’s preferences online, through exploration. We validate our approach
  experimentally in simulated discrete and continuous partially observed search-and-recover
  domains. Visit http://tinyurl.com/chitnis-corl-18 for a supplementary video.
