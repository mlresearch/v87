title: Sim-to-Real Transfer with Neural-Augmented Robot Simulation
abstract: Despite the recent successes of deep reinforcement learning, teaching complex
  motor skills to a physical robot remains a hard problem. While learning directly
  on a real system is usually impractical, doing so in simulation has proven to be
  fast and safe. Nevertheless, because of the "reality gap," policies trained in simulation
  often perform poorly when deployed on a real system. In this work, we introduce
  a method for training a recurrent neural network on the differences between simulated
  and real robot trajectories and then using this model to augment the simulator.
  This Neural-Augmented Simulation (NAS) can be used to learn control policies that
  transfer significantly better to real environments than policies learned on existing
  simulators. We demonstrate the potential of our approach through a set of experiments
  on the Mujoco simulator with added backlash and the Poppy Ergo Jr robot. NAS allows
  us to learn policies that are competitive with ones that would have been learned
  directly on the real robot.
