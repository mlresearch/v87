title: Domain Randomization for Simulation-Based Policy Optimization with Transferability
  Assessment
abstract: 'Exploration-based reinforcement learning on real robot systems is generally
  time-intensive and can lead to catastrophic robot failures. Therefore, simulation-based
  policy search appears to be an appealing alternative. Unfor- tunately, running policy
  search on a slightly faulty simulator can easily lead to the maximization of the
  ‘Simulation Optimization Bias’ (SOB), where the policy exploits modeling errors
  of the simulator such that the resulting behavior can potentially damage the robot.
  For this reason, much work in robot reinforcement learning has focused on model-free
  methods that learn on real-world systems. The resulting lack of safe simulation-based
  policy learning techniques imposes severe limitations on the application of robot
  reinforcement learning. In this paper, we explore how physics simulations can be
  utilized for a robust policy optimization by perturbing the simulator’s parameters
  and training from model ensembles. We propose a new algorithm called Simulation-based
  Policy Optimization with Transferability Assessment (SPOTA) that uses a biased estimator
  of the SOB to formulate a stopping criterion for training. We show that the new
  simulation-based policy search algorithm is able to learn a control policy exclusively
  from a randomized simulator that can be applied directly to a different system without
  using any data from the latter. '
