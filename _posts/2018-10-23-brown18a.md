title: Risk-Aware Active Inverse Reinforcement Learning
abstract: 'Active learning from demonstration allows a robot to query a human for
  specific types of input to achieve efficient learning. Existing work has explored
  a variety of active query strategies; however, to our knowledge, none of these strategies
  directly minimize the performance risk of the policy the robot is learning. Utilizing
  recent advances in performance bounds for inverse reinforcement learning, we propose
  a risk-aware active inverse reinforcement learning algorithm that focuses active
  queries on areas of the state space with the potential for large generalization
  error. We show that risk-aware active learning outperforms standard active IRL approaches
  on gridworld, simulated driving, and table setting tasks, while also providing a
  performance-based stopping criterion that allows a robot to know when it has received
  enough demonstrations to safely perform a task. '
