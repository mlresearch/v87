title: Modular Vehicle Control for Transferring Semantic Information Between Weather
  Conditions Using GANs
abstract: 'Even though end-to-end supervised learning has shown promising results
  for sensorimotor control of self-driving cars, its performance is greatly affected
  by the weather conditions under which it was trained, showing poor generalization
  to unseen conditions. In this paper, we show how knowledge can be transferred using
  semantic maps to new weather conditions without the need to obtain new ground truth
  data. To this end, we propose to divide the task of vehicle control into two independent
  modules: a control module which is only trained on one weather condition for which
  labeled steering data is available, and a perception module which is used as an
  interface between new weather conditions and the fixed control module. To generate
  the semantic data needed to train the perception module, we propose to use a generative
  adversarial network (GAN)-based model to retrieve the semantic information for the
  new conditions in an unsupervised manner. We introduce a master-servant architecture,
  where the master model (semantic labels available) trains the servant model (semantic
  labels not available). We show that our proposed method trained with ground truth
  data for a single weather condition is capable of achieving similar results on the
  task of steering angle prediction as an end-to-end model trained with ground truth
  data of 15 different weather conditions. '
