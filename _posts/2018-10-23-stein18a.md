title: Learning over Subgoals for Efficient Navigation of Structured, Unknown Environments
abstract: "\r We propose a novel technique for efficiently navigating unknown environments
  over long horizons by learning to predict properties of unknown space. We generate
  a dynamic action set defined by the current map, factor the Bellman Equation in
  terms of these actions, and estimate terms, such as the probability that navigating
  beyond a particular subgoal will lead to a dead-end, that are otherwise difficult
  to compute. Simulated agents navigating with our Learned Subgoal Planner in real-world
  floor plans demonstrate a 21% expected decrease in cost-to-go compared to standard
  optimistic planning techniques that rely on Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm, and real-world
  agents show promising navigation performance as well. "
