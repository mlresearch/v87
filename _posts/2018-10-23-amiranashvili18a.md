title: Motion Perception in Reinforcement Learning with Dynamic Objects
abstract: 'In dynamic environments, learned controllers are supposed to take motion
  into account when selecting the action to be taken. However, in existing reinforcement
  learning works motion is rarely treated explicitly; it is rather assumed that the
  controller learns the necessary motion representation from temporal stacks of frames
  implicitly. In this paper, we show that for continuous control tasks learning an
  explicit representation of motion clearly improves the quality of the learned controller
  in dynamic scenarios. We demonstrate this on common benchmark tasks (Walker, Swimmer,
  Hopper), on target reaching and ball catching tasks with simulated robotic arms,
  and on a dynamic single ball juggling task. Moreover, we find that when equipped
  with an appropriate network architecture, the agent can, on some tasks, learn motion
  features also with pure reinforcement learning, without additional supervision. '
