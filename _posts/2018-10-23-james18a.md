title: Task-Embedded Control Networks for Few-Shot Imitation Learning
abstract: 'Much like humans, robots should have the ability to leverage knowledge
  from previously learned tasks in order to learn new tasks quickly in new and unfamiliar
  environments. Despite this, most robot learning approaches have focused on learning
  a single task, from scratch, with a limited notion of generalisation, and no way
  of leveraging the knowledge to learn other tasks more efficiently. One possible
  solution is meta-learning, but many of the related approaches are limited in their
  ability to scale to a large number of tasks and to learn further tasks without forgetting
  previously learned ones. With this in mind, we introduce Task-Embedded Control Networks,
  which employ ideas from metric learning in order to create a task embedding that
  can be used by a robot to learn new tasks from one or more demonstrations. In the
  area of visually-guided manipulation, we present simulation results in which we
  surpass the performance of a state-of-the-art method when using only visual information
  from each demonstration. Additionally, we demonstrate that our approach can also
  be used in conjunction with domain randomisation to train our few-shot learning
  ability in simulation and then deploy in the real world without any additional training.
  Once deployed, the robot can learn new tasks from a single real-world demonstration. '
