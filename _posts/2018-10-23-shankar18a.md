title: Learning Neural Parsers with Deterministic Differentiable Imitation Learning
abstract: "\r We explore the problem of learning to decompose spatial tasks into segments,
  as exemplified by the problem of a painting robot covering a large object. Inspired
  by the ability of classical decision tree algorithms to construct structured parti-
  tions of their input spaces, we formulate the problem of decomposing objects into
  segments as a parsing approach. We make the insight that the derivation of a parse-tree
  that decomposes the object into segments closely resembles a decision tree constructed
  by ID3, which can be done when the ground-truth available. We learn to imitate an
  expert parsing oracle, such that our neural parser can generalize to parse natural
  images without ground truth. We introduce a novel deterministic policy gradient
  update, DRAG (i.e., DeteRministically AGgrevate) in the form of a deterministic
  actor-critic variant of AggreVaTeD [1], to train our neural parser. From another
  perspective, our approach is a variant of the Deterministic Policy Gradient [2,
  3] suitable for the imitation learning setting. The deterministic policy representation
  offered by training our neural parser with DRAG allows it to outperform state of
  the art imitation and reinforcement learning approaches. "
