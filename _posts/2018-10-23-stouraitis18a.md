title: Dyadic collaborative Manipulation through Hybrid Trajectory Optimization
abstract: 'This work provides a principled formalism to address the joint planning
  problem in dyadic collaborative manipulation (DcM) scenarios by representing the
  human’s intentions as task space forces and solving the joint problem holistically
  via model-based optimization. The proposed method is the first to empower robotic
  agents with the ability to plan in hybrid spaces—optimizing over discrete contact
  locations, continuous trajectory and force profiles, for co-manipulation tasks with
  varied dyadic objective goals. This ability is particularly important in large object
  manipulation scenarios that typically require change of grasp-holds. The task of
  finding the contact points, forces and the respective timing of grasp-hold changes
  are carried out by a joint optimization using non-linear solvers. We demonstrate
  the efficacy of the optimization method by investigating the effect of robot policy
  changes (trajectories, timings, grasp-holds) based on changes in collaborative partner
  policies using physically based dynamic simulations. We also realize, in hardware,
  effective co-manipulation of a large object by the human and the robot, including
  eminent grasp changes as well as optimal dyadic interactions to realize the joint
  task. '
