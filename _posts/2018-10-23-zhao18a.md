title: Energy-Based Hindsight Experience Prioritization
abstract: 'In Hindsight Experience Replay (HER), a reinforcement learning agent is
  trained by treating whatever it has achieved as virtual goals. However, in pre-
  vious work, the experience was replayed at random, without considering which episode
  might be the most valuable for learning. In this paper, we develop an energy-based
  framework for prioritizing hindsight experience in robotic manipulation tasks. Our
  approach is inspired by the work-energy principle in physics. We define a trajectory
  energy function as the sum of the transition energy of the target object over the
  trajectory. We hypothesize that replaying episodes that have high trajectory energy
  is more effective for reinforcement learning in robotics. To verify our hypothesis,
  we designed a framework for hindsight experience prioritization based on the trajectory
  energy of goal states. The trajectory energy function takes the potential, kinetic,
  and rotational energy into consideration. We evaluate our Energy-Based Prioritization
  (EBP) approach on four challenging robotic manipulation tasks in simulation. Our
  empirical results show that our proposed method surpasses state-of-the-art approaches
  in terms of both performance and sample-efficiency on all four tasks, without increas-
  ing computational time. A video showing experimental results is available at https://youtu.be/jtsF2tTeUGQ. '
