title: 'Robustness via Retrying: Closed-Loop Robotic Manipulation with Self-Supervised
  Learning'
abstract: Prediction is an appealing objective for self-supervised learning of behavioral
  skills, particularly for autonomous robots. However, effectively utilizing predictive
  models for control, especially with raw image inputs, poses a number of major challenges.
  How should the predictions be used? What happens when they are inaccurate? In this
  paper, we tackle these questions by proposing a method for learning robotic skills
  from raw image observations, using only autonomously collected experience. We show
  that even an imperfect model can complete complex tasks if it can continuously retry,
  but this requires the model to not lose track of the objective (e.g., the object
  of interest). To enable a robot to continuously retry a task, we devise a self-supervised
  algorithm for learning image registration, which can keep track of objects of interest
  for the duration of the trial. We demonstrate that this idea can be combined with
  a video-prediction based controller to enable complex behaviors to be learned from
  scratch using only raw visual inputs, including grasping, repositioning objects,
  and non-prehensile manipulation. Our real-world experiments demonstrate that a model
  trained with 160 robot hours of autonomously collected, unlabeled data is able to
  successfully perform complex manipulation tasks with a wide range of objects not
  seen during training.
