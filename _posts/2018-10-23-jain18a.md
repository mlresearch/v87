title: Efficient Hierarchical Robot Motion Planning Under Uncertainty and Hybrid Dynamics
abstract: 'Noisy observations coupled with nonlinear dynamics pose one of the biggestchallengesinrobotmotionplanning.
  Bydecomposingnonlineardynamics into a discrete set of local dynamics models, hybrid
  dynamics provide a natural way to model nonlinear dynamics, especially in systems
  with sudden discontinuities in dynamics due to factors such as contacts. We propose
  a hierarchical POMDP planner that develops cost-optimized motion plans for hybrid
  dynamics models. The hierarchical planner first develops a high-level motion plan
  to sequence the local dynamics models to be visited and then converts it into a
  detailed continuous state plan. This hierarchical planning approach results in a
  decomposition of the POMDP planning problem into smaller sub-parts that can be solved
  with significantly lower computational costs. The ability to sequence the visitation
  of local dynamics models also provides a powerful way to leverage the hybrid dynamics
  to reduce state uncertainty. We evaluate the proposed planner on a navigation task
  in the simulated domain and on an assembly task with a robotic manipulator, showing
  that our approach can solve tasks having high observation noise and nonlinear dynamics
  effectively with significantly lower computational costs compared to direct planning
  approaches. '
