title: Intervention Aided Reinforcement Learning for Safe and Practical Policy Optimization
  in Navigation
abstract: 'Combining deep neural networks with reinforcement learning has shown great
  potential in the next-generation intelligent control. However, there are challenges
  in terms of safety and cost in practical applications. In this pa- per, we propose
  the Intervention Aided Reinforcement Learning (IARL) framework, which utilizes human
  intervened robot-environment interaction to improve the policy. We used the Unmanned
  Aerial Vehicle (UAV) as the test platform. We built neural networks as our policy
  to map sensor readings to control signals on the UAV. Our experiment scenarios cover
  both simulation and reality. We show that our approach substantially reduces the
  human intervention and improves the performance in autonomous navigation1, at the
  same time it ensures safety and keeps training cost acceptable. '
