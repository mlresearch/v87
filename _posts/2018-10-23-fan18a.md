title: 'SURREAL: Open-Source Reinforcement Learning Framework and Robot Manipulation
  Benchmark'
abstract: Reproducibility has been a significant challenge in deep reinforcement learning
  and robotics research. Open-source frameworks and standardized benchmarks can serve
  an integral role in rigorous evaluation and reproducible research.  We introduce
  SURREAL, an open-source scalable framework that supports state-of-the-art distributed
  reinforcement learning algorithms. We design a principled distributed learning formulation
  that accommodates both on-policy and off-policy learning. We demonstrate that SURREAL
  algorithms outperform existing open-source implementations in both agent performance
  and learning efficiency. We also introduce SURREAL Robotics Suite, an accessible
  set of benchmarking tasks in physical simulation for reproducible robot manipulation
  research. We provide extensive evaluations of SURREAL algorithms and establish strong
  baseline results.
