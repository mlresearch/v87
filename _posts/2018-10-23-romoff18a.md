title: Reward Estimation for Variance Reduction in Deep Reinforcement Learning
abstract: 'Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents require the specification of a reward
  signal for learning behaviours. However, introduction of corrupt or stochastic rewards
  can yield high variance in learning. Such corruption may be a direct result of goal
  misspecification, randomness in the reward signal, or correlation of the reward
  with external factors that are not known to the agent. Corruption or stochasticity
  of the reward signal can be especially problematic in robotics, where goal specification
  can be particularly difficult for complex tasks. While many variance reduction techniques
  have been studied to improve the robustness of the RL process, handling such stochastic
  or corrupted reward structures remains difficult. As an alternative for handling
  this scenario in model-free RL methods, we suggest using an estimator for both rewards
  and value functions. We demonstrate that this improves performance under corrupted
  stochastic rewards in both the tabular and non-linear function approximation settings
  for a variety of noise types and environments. The use of reward estimation is a
  robust and easy-to-implement improvement for handling corrupted reward signals in
  model-free RL. '
