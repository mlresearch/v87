title: Feature Learning for Scene Flow Estimation from LIDAR
abstract: 'To perform tasks in dynamic environments, many mobile robots must estimate
  the motion in the surrounding world. Recently, techniques have been developed to
  estimate scene flow directly from LIDAR scans, relying on hand-designed features.
  In this work, we build an encoding network to learn features from an occupancy grid.
  The network is trained so that these features are discriminative in finding matching
  or non-matching locations between successive timesteps. This learned feature space
  is then leveraged to estimate scene flow. We evaluate our method on the KITTI dataset
  and demonstrate performance that improves upon the accuracy of the current state-of-the-art.
  We provide an implementation of our method at https://github.com/aushani/flsf. '
