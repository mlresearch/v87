title: Inferring geometric constraints in human demonstrations
abstract: 'This paper presents an approach for inferring geometric constraints in
  human demonstrations. In our method, geometric constraint models are built to create
  representations of kinematic constraints such as fixed point, axial rotation, prismatic
  motion, planar motion and others across multiple degrees of freedom. Our method
  infers geometric constraints using both kinematic and force/torque information.
  The approach first fits all the constraint models using kinematic information and
  evaluates them individually using position, force and moment criteria. Our approach
  does not require information about the constraint type or contact geometry; it can
  determine both simultaneously. We present experimental evaluations using instrumented
  tongs that show how constraints can be robustly inferred in recordings of human
  demonstrations. '
