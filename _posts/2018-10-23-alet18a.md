title: Modular meta-learning
abstract: Many prediction problems, such as those that arise in the context of robotics,
  have a simplifying underlying structure that, if known, could accelerate learning.
  In this paper, we present a strategy for learning a set of neural network modules
  that can be combined in different ways. We train different modular structures on
  a set of related tasks and generalize to new tasks by composing the learned modules
  in new ways. By reusing modules to generalize we achieve combinatorial generalization,
  akin to the ”infinite use of finite means” displayed in language. Finally, we show
  this improves performance in two robotics-related problems.
