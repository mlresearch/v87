title: Global Search with Bernoulli Alternation Kernel for Task-oriented Grasping
  Informed by Simulation
abstract: 'We develop an approach that benefits from large simulated datasets and
  takes full advantage of the limited online data that is most relevant. We propose
  a variant of Bayesian optimization that alternates between using informed and uninformed
  kernels. With this Bernoulli Alternation Kernel we ensure that discrepancies between
  simulation and reality do not hinder adapting robot control policies online. The
  proposed approach is applied to a challenging real-world problem of task-oriented
  grasping with novel objects. Our further contribution is a neural network architecture
  and training pipeline that use experience from grasping objects in simulation to
  learn grasp stability scores. We learn task scores from a labeled dataset with a
  convolutional network, which is used to construct an informed kernel for our variant
  of Bayesian optimization. Experiments on an ABB Yumi robot with real sensor data
  demonstrate success of our approach, despite the challenge of fulfilling task requirements
  and high uncertainty over physical properties of objects. '
