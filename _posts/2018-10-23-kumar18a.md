title: Expanding Motor Skills using Relay Networks
abstract: 'While recent advances in deep reinforcement learning have achieved impressive
  results in learning motor skills, many policies are only capable within a limited
  set of initial states. We propose an algorithm that sequentially decomposes a complex
  robotic task into simpler subtasks and trains a local policy for each subtask such
  that the robot can expand its existing skill set gradually. Our key idea is to build
  a directed graph of local control policies represented by neural networks, which
  we refer to as relay neural networks. Starting from the first policy that attempts
  to achieve the task from a small set of initial states, the algorithm iteratively
  discovers the next subtask with increasingly more difficult initial states until
  the last subtask matches the initial state distribution of the original task. The
  policy of each subtask aims to drive the robot to a state where the policy of its
  preceding subtask is able to handle. By taking advantage of many existing actor-critic
  style policy search algorithms, we utilize the optimized value function to define
  “good states” for the next policy to relay to. '
