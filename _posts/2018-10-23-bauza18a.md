title: A Data-Efficient Approach to Precise and Controlled Pushing
abstract: 'Decades of research in control theory have shown that simple controllers,
  when provided with timely feedback, can control complex systems. Pushing is an example
  of a complex mechanical system that is difficult to model accurately due to unknown
  system parameters such as coefficients of friction and pressure distributions. In
  this paper, we explore the data-complexity required for controlling, rather than
  modeling, such a system. Results show that a model-based control approach, where
  the dynamical model is learned from data, is capable of performing complex pushing
  trajectories with a minimal amount of training data (<10 data points). The dynamics
  of pushing interactions are modeled using a Gaussian process (GP) and are leveraged
  within a model predictive control approach that linearizes the GP and imposes actuator
  and task constraints for a planar manipulation task. '
