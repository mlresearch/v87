title: Driving Policy Transfer via Modularity and Abstraction
abstract: End-to-end approaches to autonomous driving have high sample complexity
  and are difficult to scale to realistic urban driving. Simulation can help end-to-end
  driving systems by providing a cheap, safe, and diverse training environment. Yet
  training driving policies in simulation brings up the problem of transferring such
  policies to the real world. We present an approach to transferring driving policies
  from simulation to reality via modularity and abstraction. Our approach is inspired
  by classic driving systems and aims to combine the benefits of modular architectures
  and end-to-end deep learning approaches. The key idea is to encapsulate the driving
  policy such that it is not directly exposed to raw perceptual input or low-level
  vehicle dynamics. We evaluate the presented approach in simulated urban environments
  and in the real world. In particular, we transfer a driving policy trained in simulation
  to a 1/5-scale robotic truck that is deployed in a variety of conditions, with no
  finetuning, on two continents.
