title: Curiosity Driven Exploration of Learned Disentangled Goal Spaces
abstract: 'Intrinsically motivated goal exploration processes enable agents to explore
  efficiently complex environments with high-dimensional continuous actions. They
  have been applied successfully to real world robots to discover repertoires of policies
  producing a wide diversity of effects. Often these algorithms relied on engineered
  goal spaces but it was recently shown that one can use deep representation learning
  algorithms to learn an adequate goal space in simple environments. In this paper
  we show that using a disentangled goal space (i.e. a representation where each latent
  variable is sensitive to a single degree of freedom) leads to better exploration
  performances than an entangled one. We further show that when the representation
  is disentangled, one can leverage it by sampling goals that maximize learning progress
  in a modular manner. Finally, we show that the measure of learning progress, used
  to drive curiosity-driven exploration, can be used simultaneously to discover abstract
  independently controllable features of the environment. '
