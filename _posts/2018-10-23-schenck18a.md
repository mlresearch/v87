title: 'SPNets: Differentiable Fluid Dynamics for Deep Neural Networks'
abstract: 'In this paper we introduce Smooth Particle Networks (SPNets), a framework
  for integrating fluid dynamics with deep networks. SPNets adds two new layers to
  the neural network toolbox: ConvSP and ConvSDF, which enable computing physical
  interactions with unordered particle sets. We use these layers in combination with
  standard neural network layers to directly implement fluid dynamics inside a deep
  network, where the parameters of the network are the fluid parameters themselves
  (e.g., viscosity, cohesion, etc.). Because SPNets are implemented as a neural network,
  the resulting fluid dynamics are fully differentiable. We then show how this can
  be successfully used to learn fluid parameters from data, perform liquid control
  tasks, and learn policies to manipulate liquids. '
