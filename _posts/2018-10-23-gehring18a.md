title: Adaptable replanning with compressed linear action models for learning from
  demonstrations
abstract: 'We propose an adaptable and efficient model-based reinforcement learning
  approach well suited for continuous domains with sparse samples, a setting often
  encountered when learning from demonstrations. The flexibility of our method originates
  from the approximate transition models, estimated from data, and the online replanning
  approach proposed. Together, these components allow for immediate adaptation to
  a new task, given in the form of a reward function. The efficiency of our method
  comes from two approximations. First, rather than representing a complete distribution
  over the results of taking an action, which is difficult in continuous state spaces,
  it learns a linear model of the expected transition for each action. Second, it
  uses a novel strategy for compressing these linear action models, which significantly
  reduces space and time for learning models, and supports efficient online generation
  of open-loop plans. The effectiveness of these methods is demonstrated in a simulated
  driving domain with a 20-dimensional continuous input space. '
