title: 'Dense Object Nets: Learning Dense Visual Object Descriptors By and For Robotic
  Manipulation'
abstract: 'What is the right object representation for manipulation? We would like
  robots to visually perceive scenes and learn an understanding of the objects in
  them that (i) is task-agnostic and can be used as a building block for a variety
  of manipulation tasks, (ii) is generally applicable to both rigid and non-rigid
  objects, (iii) takes advantage of the strong priors provided by 3D vision, and (iv)
  is entirely learned from self-supervision. This is hard to achieve with previous
  methods: much recent work in grasping does not extend to grasping specific objects
  or other tasks, whereas task-specific learning may require many trials to generalize
  well across object configurations or other tasks. In this paper we present Dense
  Object Nets, which build on recent developments in self-supervised dense descriptor
  learning, as a consistent object representation for visual understanding and manipulation.
  We demonstrate they can be trained quickly (approximately 20 minutes) for a wide
  variety of previously unseen and potentially non-rigid objects. We additionally
  present novel contributions to enable multi-object descriptor learning, and show
  that by modifying our training procedure, we can either acquire descriptors which
  generalize across classes of objects, or descriptors that are distinct for each
  object instance. Finally, we demonstrate the novel application of learned dense
  descriptors to robotic manipulation. We demonstrate grasping of specific points
  on an object across potentially deformed object configurations, and demonstrate
  using class general descriptors to transfer specific grasps across objects in a
  class. '
