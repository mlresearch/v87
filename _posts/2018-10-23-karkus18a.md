title: Particle Filter Networks with Application to Visual Localization
abstract: 'Particle filtering is a powerful approach to sequential state estimation
  and finds application in many domains, including robot localization, object tracking,
  etc. To apply particle filtering in practice, a critical challenge is to construct
  probabilistic system models, especially for systems with complex dynamics or rich
  sensory inputs such as camera images. This paper introduces the Particle Filter
  Network (PFnet), which encodes both a system model and a particle filter algorithm
  in a single neural network. The PF-net is fully differentiable and trained end-to-end
  from data. Instead of learning a generic system model, it learns a model optimized
  for the particle filter algorithm. We apply the PF-net to a visual localization
  task, in which a robot must localize in a rich 3-D world, using only a schematic
  2-D floor map. In simulation experiments, PF-net consistently outperforms alternative
  learning architectures, as well as a traditional model-based method, under a variety
  of sensor inputs. Further, PF-net generalizes well to new, unseen environments. '
