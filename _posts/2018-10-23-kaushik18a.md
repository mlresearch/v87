title: Multi-objective Model-based Policy Search for Data-efficient Learning with
  Sparse Rewards
abstract: 'The most data-efficient algorithms for reinforcement learning in robotics
  are model-based policy search algorithms, which alternate between learning a dynamical
  model of the robot and optimizing a policy to maximize the expected return given
  the model and its uncertainties. However, the current algorithms lack an effective
  exploration strategy to deal with sparse or misleading reward scenarios: if they
  do not experience any state with a positive reward during the initial random exploration,
  it is very unlikely to solve the problem. Here, we propose a novel model-based policy
  search algorithm, Multi-DEX, that leverages a learned dynamical model to efficiently
  explore the task space and solve tasks with sparse rewards in a few episodes. To
  achieve this, we frame the policy search problem as a multi-objective, model-based
  policy optimization problem with three objectives: (1) generate maximally novel
  state trajectories, (2) maximize the cumulative reward and (3) keep the system in
  state-space regions for which the model is as accurate as possible. We then optimize
  these objectives using a Pareto-based multi-objective optimization algorithm. The
  experiments show that Multi-DEX is able to solve sparse reward scenarios (with a
  simulated robotic arm) in much lower interaction time than VIME, TRPO, GEP-PG, CMA-ES
  and Black-DROPS. '
