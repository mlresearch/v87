title: Neural Modular Control for Embodied Question Answering
abstract: We present a modular approach for learning policies for navigation over
  long planning horizons from language input. Our hierarchical policy operates at
  multiple timescales, where the higher-level master policy proposes subgoals to be
  executed by specialized sub-policies. Our choice of subgoals is compositional and
  semantic, i.e. they can be sequentially combined in arbitrary orderings, and assume
  human-interpretable descriptions (e.g. ‘exit room’, ‘find kitchen’, ‘find refrigerator’,
  etc.). We use imitation learning to warm-start policies at each level of the hierarchy,
  dramatically increasing sample efficiency, followed by reinforcement learning. Independent
  reinforcement learning at each level of hierarchy enables sub-policies to adapt
  to consequences of their actions and recover from errors. Subsequent joint hierarchical
  training enables the master policy to adapt to the sub-policies. On the challenging
  EQA [1] benchmark in House3D [2], requiring navigating diverse realistic indoor
  environments, our approach outperforms prior work by a significant margin, both
  in terms of navigation and question answering.
